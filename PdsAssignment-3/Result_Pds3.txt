Report on your findings:

1. set a seed (to ensure work reproducibility) and take a random sample of 25 observations and
find the mean Glucose and highest Glucose values of this sample and compare these statistics
with the population statistics of the same variable. You should use charts for this comparison.

Observation:  The mean and maximum of the population are higher than those of the sample.

2.  Find the 98th percentile of BMI of your sample and the population and compare the results
using charts

Observation: The population percentile is higher than the sample percentile, as far as I can tell.

3.  Using bootstrap (replace= True), create 500 samples (of 150 observation each) from the
population and find the average mean, standard deviation and percentile for BloodPressure and
compare this with these statistics from the population for the same variable. Again, you should
create charts for this comparison. Report on your findings

Observation: There is a tiny distinction between bootstrap and population statistics.
